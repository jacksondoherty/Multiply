Multiply! 1v1 Online Third Person Shooter for PC (in development).

You are a minion.  Your opponent is a minion.  You can clone
yourself to produce helper minions to fight your opponent and hide
among them.  The game ends when one of the “true” minions (the ones 
you and your opponent control) dies.

Move with WSAD or arrow keys
Turn/Aim with mouse
Left-click to fire
Spacebar to multiply (clone yourself)

Currently working on game design (ex. limiting # of clones players can 
produce), 3d models, more functionality (ex. clone formations), clone AI.
