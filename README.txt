Multiply! 1v1 Online Third Person Shooter for PC.

You are a minion.  Your opponent is a minion.  You can clone
yourself to produce helper minions to fight your opponent and hide
among them.  You can throw donuts to distract your opponent’s clones.
The game ends when one of the “true” minions (the ones you and your 
opponent control) dies.

ESCAPE or Q to quit
P to pause
Move with WSAD or arrow keys
Turn/Aim with mouse
Left-click to fire
Right-click to throw donut
Spacebar to multiply (clone yourself)

* NOTE: if a player stands next to a wall, facing it and throws a donut,
it will propel into the air.  This is funny but occasionally breaks the
game - will fix when have time.
